## Development

A React **Native app** is typically made up of different screens that represent different views of the application. These screens are usually created as separate **TSX files** and can be navigated to using a navigation system.   

Within each screen, there are different **components** that make up the UI of the app. These components can be custom-built or imported from external libraries. For example, a screen might contain a header component, a content component, and a footer component.   

One of the most commonly used components in React Native is the **FlatList** component, which is used to display a list of data in a scrollable view. This component can be used to render dynamic lists of data, such as a list of cards.   

To navigate between screens, React Native provides several built-in **navigation components**, such as *StackNavigator* and *TabNavigator*. These components allow users to move between screens using swipe gestures or by tapping on buttons.   

To manage the state of an app, React Native developers often use a global state management tool like **Redux**. Redux allows developers to store and manage the state of an app in a single place, making it easier to manage and update the state of the app.   

For persisting data between app sessions, developers can use **Async Storage**, which is a built-in React Native module that allows data to be stored locally on the device. This can be useful for storing user preferences, login information, or any other data that needs to persist between app sessions.   

React Native also provides a **Context** API, which allows data to be passed down through a hierarchy of components without having to explicitly pass it as props. This can be useful for sharing data that needs to be accessed by multiple components throughout the app.   

Finally, to ensure the quality and stability of the app, React Native developers often write **tests** using frameworks like *Jest* and Enzyme. These tests can be used to test individual components, screen navigation, state management, and more, helping to catch bugs and issues early in the development process.
